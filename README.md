• Engineered a comprehensive prefix tree structure in Python to optimize
auto-completion operations, enhancing efficiency in data handling with
hierarchical storage of values by prefixes.

• Developed multiple auto-completion engines, including text-based and
melody-based variants, employing advanced tree manipulations and data
sanitization techniques.

• Integrated audio processing functionalities using Python libraries like pygame
for multimedia handling and mido for MIDI file manipulation, enabling the
simulation and playback of musical data.
